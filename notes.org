* Things to learn and install
** Emacs saving macros and editting their bindings easily without .emacs
** CEDET?
   Speedbar at least, seems CEDET might require a lot of hacking to worth with go projects
   https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsCodeBrowser
   Does etags support go? If so, might be easy
** Abbrevs
*** https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Abbrevs.html#Abbrevs
*** Make a global keybinding for define-global-abbrev
*** C-x a g : define abbrev expanding into words before point
*** C-x a l : just for the current major-mode
*** M-/ : dynamic abbrev = search for a completion
*** why when I abbrev-prefix-mark is there a newline inserted

** https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi and associated modes?
* Things I want to incorporate into workflows in the future
** Projectile mode - project utilities like search-project - https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile
** Keys from prelude-mode - https://prelude.emacsredux.com/en/latest/usage/
** Helm - fancy autocomplete/searching - maybe not right away
** questionable things - maybe, maybe not
* maybes
** put avy-goto-char-timer back on C-c j
** anzu for refactoring - anzu-replace-at-cursor-thing
** (setq tab-always-indent 'complete)
* definite keeps
zop-to-char
crux-move-beginning-of-line binding
anzu (unless swiper)
* well-known config files for reference

* navigation vs searching vs etc
I have swiper for searching in buffer, which can ALSO be used for navigation
  then avy can be used for navigation, but only for things for that are visible... so maybe that's not worth it? but it can also switch windows

anzu is like a super lightweight isearch improvement, much less than swiper
* swiper
Calling search while point is near the bottom moves things to keep point showing -- is there something better?
It doesn't put shortcuts for reverse by default... neither C-r from global map, nor C-r from swiper-mode or whatever it is
swiper-mode select options the way company-mode has
swiper-mode but in a window the way company-mode has?? or in a large buffer? good for navigation
* Do something to have company off in org-mode -- also move it it prog-mode-hook or ??
* Grep
** unbind counsel-git-grep C-c j
** add git-grep to projectile's project search -- maybe? if its builtin grep isn't good enough? or just use rg?
** projectile also has a (customizable) option (projectile-use-git-grep) for using uh, git grep
(projectile-update-mode-line)
* Why is flycheck giving me a squiggle for (setq projectile-mode-line-function ...)?
* I feel like the undo tracking system batches things in bigger batches, not sure if I like it
* Questions or decisions
** Which modes do I want to diminish?
** delight instead of diminish? seems like an improvement
** does which-function-mode works in org-mode reasonably?
** use-package?
 https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package
** Do I like ctrl-backspace for kill-line-backwards and indent ... maybe that's okay!
** Do I want to use hippie-expand for anything, or just put company-complete on that during modes
** smex vs counsel M-x
* easy things
** Install CGH as a prelude-search-engine
** remove counsel-find-file and go back to find-file with ido-mode
** change to use ido-mode for file
** recover my paren settings from work laptop
** remap query-replace, query-replace-regex with, at minimum, anzu
